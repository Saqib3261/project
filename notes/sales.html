        Pricing and Price Reductions/Corrections<br><br>
        Apple reserves the right to change prices for products displayed on the Apple Store at any time and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Any price changes will not affect an order that has already been accepted by Apple. In the event of a pricing error, we will notify you of the error and allow you to either proceed with the transaction at the correct price or cancel your order at no cost to you. Additional information about pricing and taxes is available in the Payment & Pricing section of the Help page located at https://www.apple.com/in/shop/help/payments.<br><br>
        In addition to your right to cancel your order, return a product or cancel a service contract for any reason as explained above, should Apple reduce its price on any Apple-branded product within 14 calendar days from the date you receive your product, feel free to contact the Apple Store by freephone on 000800 040 1966 to request a refund or credit of the difference between the price you were charged and the current selling price. To receive the refund or credit, you must contact Apple within 14 calendar days of the price change. Please note that this excludes limited-time price reductions, such as those that occur during special sales events.<br><br>
